# Hindi-Handwriting-Recognition
We attempt to perform image classification on the Devanagari character set. For an input of handwritten Devanagari symbols,  our model will output the category label (character name) of each character. 
I have used convolutional neural networks. I am using Tensorflow as the framework and Keras API for providing a high level of abstraction.
